""" The function is given a string prefix_exp_str, which contains an arithmetic
expression in a prefix notation.
When called, it creates and returns a LinkedBinaryTree object, that is the
expression tree representing prefix_exp_str.

    Assume that prefix expression will come in the following format:
1. All operators in the expression will be taken from the four basic arithmetic
operations (+, -, * and /).
2. All operands will be positive integers.
3. The tokens in the expression will be separated by a space.

    Implementation requirements:
1. The nodes containing operators, should have the operator as a string, and
nodes containing numerals, should have the number as an int.
2. The runtime for creating the expression tree should be linear.
3. You are not allowed to use a stack in your implementation.

Hint: There is more than one way to solve this problem. One way is to start by
creating a list with the expressionâ€™s tokens (by using the split method), and then
calling a helper function:
